# Codee: Student Chatbot

Codee is a chatbot designed to assist Tech Elevator students with their job search. 

## Description
Codee prompts students and responds to keywords with relevant information. He can help students find information on a broad variety of topics related to their job search, including help with resumes, interview prep, and more. Codee can also give students motivational quotes or humorous memes if they need a little pick-me-up. If students need help preparing for technical interview questions, they can ask Codee for sample questions.

### Features
#### Pathway Help: 
Students can ask for help finding resources related to the Pathway Program. They can identify broad topics and drill down to specific bits of information, presentations, or videos. They can even get help figuring out what to wear to an interview!
#### Interview Prep:
Students can request sample interview questions either by prompting Codee via the input bar or by clicking the "Interview" button on the left-hand navigation bar. Each question has three options, students can submit their answer, and Codee will let them know if their answer was correct.
#### Emotional Support:
If students need a little pick-me-up, Codee can respond to requests with a motivational quote or a humorous meme from the Programmer Humor subreddit.
#### Email Chat Log:
If students would like to keep track of a resource Codee recommends or a dank meme, they can choose to save their chat by emailing it to themselves. They can also send the most recent set of Codee messages to a friend!
#### Talk to Codee:
Codee has both speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality, meaning you can talk to Codee and he can talk back! 

To talk to Codee just click the microphone button to the right of the input field and make your request. Click it again for Codee to stop listening and send your request. 

To have Codee talk to you, just click the "Talk to me" button on the left-hand navigation. Codee will then read the last set of messages to you!
